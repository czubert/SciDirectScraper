# SciDirectScraper
ScienceDirect parser to get email addresses of corrsponding authors.

There are three options to run this application
1. via main.py, where you should define the variables
2. via vis.py (streamlit run vis.py). It is a GUI. There is a chance that you will have to unhash local paths, and hash the active ones to make it work
3. running "pynsist installer.cfg" which will create an installation file (.exe) in build/nsis folder. Also you can just run SciScrapper.launch.py to run it locally from "build" folder
